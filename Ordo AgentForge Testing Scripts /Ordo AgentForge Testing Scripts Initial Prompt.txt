I need to implement comprehensive testing for my multi-tenant AI dashboard application.

I have 3 testing strategy documents located in the folder 'Ordo AgentForge Testing Scripts':
1. PHASED_TESTING_STRATEGY.md - For testing during each build phase
2. TESTING_STRATEGY.md - For comprehensive testing after completion
3. TESTING_STRATEGY_COMPLETE.md - Hybrid reference guide

Since I'm currently building the application in phases, I want to use the 
PHASED_TESTING_STRATEGY.md approach to test each component as I build it.

FIRST, help me set up the testing infrastructure:

## Step 1: Create Test Configuration

Please read PHASED_TESTING_STRATEGY.md and create the initial test setup:

1. Create vitest.config.ts with:
   - TypeScript configuration
   - happy-dom environment
   - Path aliases (@/ imports)
   - Coverage thresholds (85% minimum)
   - Mock configurations for Supabase and Clerk

2. Create src/__tests__/setup.ts with:
   - Global test utilities
   - Mock environment variables
   - Test database configuration

3. Create src/__tests__/utils/testUtils.tsx with:
   - Custom render function with all providers (UserContext, WorkspaceContext, ToolsContext)
   - Mock helpers
   - Common test scenarios

4. Create src/__tests__/mocks/ folder with:
   - supabaseMock.ts
   - clerkMock.ts
   - apiMocks.ts

After you create these files, I'll tell you which phase I'm currently on, 
and we'll create tests for that specific phase.

Start with the test configuration setup now.
